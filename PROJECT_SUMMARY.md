# Project Summary – High-Performance Crypto Order Book

## Executive Summary

A production-quality order book matching engine implemented in Rust, featuring:
- **Real-time Binance WebSocket integration** for live market data
- **High-performance order matching** with price-time priority algorithm
- **Professional code architecture** based on established C++ reference implementation
- **Thread-safe concurrent design** using Rust async patterns

## What This Demonstrates

### Technical Skills
✅ **Advanced Rust**: Async/await, smart pointers (Arc/Mutex), trait systems
✅ **Data Structures**: BTreeMap, VecDeque, HashMap for optimal performance
✅ **Algorithms**: Price-time priority matching, FIFO queue management
✅ **Concurrency**: Tokio runtime, concurrent task spawning, thread-safe state
✅ **Network Programming**: WebSocket protocol, JSON parsing, reconnection logic
✅ **Systems Design**: Clean architecture, separation of concerns, extensibility

### Domain Knowledge
✅ **Market Microstructure**: Order books, bid/ask spreads, market depth
✅ **Order Types**: Limit orders, market orders, good-till-cancel
✅ **Trade Execution**: Price-time priority, partial fills, trade generation
✅ **Real-Time Data**: Streaming market data, ticker feeds, depth updates

## Quick Demo

```bash
cargo run --release
```

**Output shows:**
1. Live WebSocket connection to Binance
2. Order book operations (add, match, cancel)
3. Trade generation with price-time priority
4. Real-time market data updates
5. Order book depth visualization

## Architecture Highlights

### Order Book Engine
```rust
BTreeMap<Price, PriceLevel>  // Sorted price levels
  └─> VecDeque<Order>        // FIFO queue at each price
HashMap<OrderId, Side>        // Fast order lookup
```

### WebSocket Integration
```rust
BinanceFeed
  ├─> Ticker Feed (price updates)
  └─> Depth Feed (order book depth)
```

### Concurrency Model
```rust
SharedOrderBook: Arc<Mutex<OrderBook>>     // Thread-safe order book
MarketData: Arc<RwLock<Vec<MarketData>>>   // Concurrent reads
```

## Interview Talking Points

### 1. Order Book Design
**"I implemented a limit order book using BTreeMap for O(log n) price level access and VecDeque for FIFO queues at each price, ensuring price-time priority matching."**

- Based on professional C++ reference (Tzadiko)
- Efficient data structure choices
- Clean separation of concerns

### 2. Async Architecture
**"The system uses Tokio for concurrent WebSocket feeds, with proper error handling and automatic reconnection logic."**

- Non-blocking I/O
- Concurrent task management
- Production-quality patterns

### 3. Order Matching
**"The matching engine implements price-time priority: best prices match first, and among orders at the same price, earlier orders have priority."**

- Correct market semantics
- Trade generation
- Partial fill support

### 4. Type Safety
**"Rust's type system ensures memory safety and prevents common bugs like use-after-free, while Arc<Mutex> provides thread-safe shared ownership."**

- No manual memory management
- Compile-time safety guarantees
- Safe concurrency
