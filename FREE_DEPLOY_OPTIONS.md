## Option 3: Just Run Locally & Share with ngrok

If you just want to **demo it quickly**:

```bash

cargo run --release --bin simple_trading_engine

# In another terminal, install ngrok
brew install ngrok

# Share your local server
ngrok http 8080
```

You'll get a public URL like: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`
