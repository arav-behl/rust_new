### LinkedIn Section:
```
🚀 Just deployed my Rust trading engine!

Built a real-time cryptocurrency trading system that processes live
market data from Binance WebSocket feeds. The system handles concurrent
data streams, maintains thread-safe state with Arc/RwLock, and exposes
a REST API for order execution.

## 📧 For Cover Letters

> "I recently built and deployed a live cryptocurrency trading engine
> in Rust (https://your-app.up.railway.app). The system processes
> real-time market data from Binance WebSocket feeds and demonstrates
> production Rust patterns including async/await, concurrent state
> management, and REST API development. I'd love to discuss how my
> systems programming experience aligns with [Company's] needs."

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Build Failed
**Check Railway logs:**
- Click "Deployments" tab
- Click failed deployment
- Read error message
- Most common: First build timeout (just redeploy)

**Local test:**
```bash
docker build -t test .
docker run -p 8080:8080 test
# Visit localhost:8080
```

### App Won't Load
- **Wait 30 seconds** (free tier wakes from sleep)
- Check Railway dashboard shows "Active"
- Try hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)

### WebSocket Not Connecting
- Check browser console (F12)
- Verify you're using `https://` not `http://`
- Railway supports WSS automatically

### Want Always-On (No Sleep)
- Railway free tier sleeps after inactivity
- Upgrade to Hobby plan ($5/mo) for always-on
- Or note on resume: "Demo may take 30s to wake"

## 🎬 Demo Your Live Link

When recruiters visit your link, they'll see:

**First Impression (0-5 seconds):**
- Clean, professional interface
- Live market data already loading
- Clear purpose (trading engine)

**Interaction (5-30 seconds):**
- Can submit test orders
- See portfolio update
- Watch real-time price changes

**Technical Validation (30-60 seconds):**
- Open browser console → See WebSocket messages
